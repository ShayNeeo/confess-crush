## Technical Questions for Review

### 1. Data Processing and Feature Engineering
- **Question:** Is the current approach to outlier detection (IQR + domain rules) sufficient, or should we implement more sophisticated methods like Isolation Forest or Local Outlier Factor?
- **Context:** Currently using IQR with business logic validation. Wondering about trade-offs between simplicity and detection accuracy.

### 2. Model Selection and Validation
- **Question:** Given the temporal nature of customer behavior, should we implement time-series cross-validation instead of random train-test splits?
- **Context:** Current validation uses random splits. Customer behavior may have temporal dependencies that standard CV doesn't capture.

### 3. Class Imbalance Handling
- **Question:** Is SMOTE the optimal choice for this use case, or should we explore other techniques like ADASYN, BorderlineSMOTE, or cost-sensitive learning?
- **Context:** Using SMOTE for class balancing. Unsure if synthetic samples adequately represent real customer behavior patterns.

### 4. Feature Selection Strategy
- **Question:** Should we implement automated feature selection (RFE, SelectKBest) before model training, or is the current domain-driven approach sufficient?
- **Context:** Currently using all engineered features. Concerned about potential overfitting and computational efficiency.

### 5. Customer Segmentation Optimization
- **Question:** Would hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN provide better customer segments than K-means, especially for identifying outlier customer behaviors?
- **Context:** Using K-means with optimal k selection. Wondering if other clustering methods might reveal more actionable customer segments.

### 6. Model Interpretability vs Performance Trade-off
- **Question:** How should we balance model interpretability (favoring simpler models) against predictive performance (favoring ensemble methods)?
- **Context:** Current best model is RandomForest (interpretable) vs potentially better performing but less interpretable neural networks.

### 7. Evaluation Metrics Selection
- **Question:** Given the business context, should we prioritize Precision (minimize false positives) or Recall (minimize false negatives) in model optimization?
- **Context:** Currently optimizing for AUC. Business cost of false positives vs false negatives is unclear.

### 8. Scalability and Production Considerations
- **Question:** What additional considerations should be implemented for production deployment (real-time scoring, model drift detection, automated retraining)?
- **Context:** Current solution is batch-oriented. Considering production requirements for real-time customer scoring.
