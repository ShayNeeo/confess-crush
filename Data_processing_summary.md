# Data Processing Summary

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the functionalities and purposes of the two main scripts in the data processing pipeline: `data_cleaning.py` and `visualization.py`. Its goal is to offer a clear understanding of how raw data is transformed into actionable insights.

---

## `data_cleaning.py`

### Overview
The `data_cleaning.py` script serves as the foundational data preparation layer. It meticulously transforms raw, often inconsistent and error-prone datasets into a structured, reliable, and analysis-ready format. This script is crucial for creating a "single source of truth," ensuring data integrity and consistency, which are paramount for accurate downstream analysis, reporting, and strategic decision-making.

### Detailed Functionalities

1.  **System Resource Management**
    *   **Purpose**: To dynamically assess the host machine's hardware capabilities (CPU cores, available RAM) and configure the processing environment for optimal performance and stability. This prevents system overloads, minimizes processing time, and optimizes for cost-efficiency, especially in cloud environments.
    *   `detect_system_resources()`: Identifies the number of CPU cores and total system memory.
    *   `get_optimal_worker_count()`: Calculates the ideal number of parallel processing workers (e.g., typically 75% of available cores, like 6 workers on an 8-core machine) to maximize CPU utilization without causing memory contention or excessive context switching.
    *   **Example**: On an 8-core machine with 32GB RAM, it might allocate 6 workers and reserve a memory buffer (e.g., 4GB), ensuring smooth operation even during memory-intensive tasks.

2.  **Memory Optimization Engine**
    *   **Purpose**: To significantly reduce the memory footprint of Pandas DataFrames, enabling the processing of larger-than-RAM datasets and speeding up computations.
    *   `optimize_memory_usage()`: Intelligently downcasts numerical data types to their smallest possible forms without loss of precision (e.g., `float64` to `float32`, `int64` to `int32` or `int16`). This can lead to 60-70% memory reduction for typical numerical datasets.
    *   `adaptive_chunk_size()`: Dynamically determines the optimal number of rows to process in each iteration (chunk) when dealing with very large files. For instance, for a 10GB dataset on a system with 8GB of usable RAM, it might process data in 1GB (or equivalent row count) chunks. This is critical for out-of-core processing.

3.  **Data Quality Framework**
    *   **Purpose**: To systematically assess and quantify the quality of the data, identifying issues that could compromise analysis.
    *   `assess_data_completeness()`: Calculates and reports the percentage of missing values for each column (e.g., 'age' column has 5% nulls, 'email' has 0.5% nulls).
    *   `assess_data_quality()`: Detects various quality issues such as outliers (e.g., using Z-scores or IQR to flag an age > 120 as invalid), incorrect data types, nonsensical values (e.g., negative purchase amounts), adherence to predefined categorical lists (e.g., 'gender' must be 'Male', 'Female', or 'Unknown'), and format validation using regular expressions (e.g., for email addresses, phone numbers).
    *   `justify_missing_value_strategy()`: Documents the rationale for choosing specific missing value imputation techniques (e.g., mean/median for numerical, mode for categorical, or more advanced methods like MICE) based on data distribution, missingness patterns (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), and potential impact on analysis.

4.  **Data Cleaning Operations**
    *   **Purpose**: To correct identified errors, standardize formats, and transform data into a consistent and usable state.
    *   Vectorized operations for efficiency (e.g., `vectorized_clean_gender()` maps various inputs like 'M', 'F', 'Male', 'Female' to standardized 'Male'/'Female'/'Unknown').
    *   Text processing: `vectorized_job_processing()` translates Vietnamese job titles to English using a predefined dictionary; `fix_vietnamese_encoding()` corrects common UTF-8 mojibake issues.
    *   Handling inconsistencies: Correcting erratic capitalization (e.g., "new york" vs "New York"), trimming leading/trailing whitespace, standardizing date/time formats (e.g., to ISO 8601), and resolving ambiguous categorical entries through rule-based logic or mapping tables.

5.  **Feature Engineering**
    *   **Purpose**: To create new, informative variables from existing data that can improve the performance of machine learning models and reveal deeper insights.
    *   `create_age_quartile_ranges()`: Bins ages into meaningful demographic groups (e.g., 'Children (0-12)', 'Teenagers (13-18)', 'Young Adults (19-25)', 'Seniors (65+)').
    *   `engineer_user_log_features()`: Derives behavioral metrics from user logs, such as total session duration, average actions per session, frequency of specific actions (clicks, purchases, adds-to-cart), click-to-purchase rates.
    *   Advanced Features: Creation of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores for customer segmentation, time-based features (e.g., "days since last purchase," "average inter-purchase duration," "day_of_week_preference"), interaction ratios (e.g., "cart abandonment rate"), and potentially NLP-derived features from text fields like product reviews or support tickets (e.g., sentiment scores, topic extraction).

6.  **Large-Scale Processing**
    *   **Purpose**: To enable efficient processing of datasets that are too large to fit into system memory (RAM).
    *   `process_chunk()`: Iteratively reads and processes large files in smaller, manageable segments (e.g., 100,000 rows at a time), applying cleaning and transformation functions to each chunk before optionally combining results. This allows for linear scalability.
    *   Disk-based operations: For extremely large operations like joins or aggregations on out-of-core data, strategies might involve temporary storage of intermediate results on disk to prevent memory overflow (e.g., using Dask or similar libraries for more complex scenarios, though the current script focuses on Pandas chunking).

7.  **Quality Assurance & Reporting**
    *   **Purpose**: To provide transparency and auditability of the data cleaning process.
    *   Automated report generation: Creates detailed JSON reports summarizing the outcomes of `assess_data_completeness` and `assess_data_quality`. These reports include before/after statistics for each column (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, unique value counts, null counts after cleaning) and parameters used for each cleaning function.
    *   Change logs: Implicitly, version control of the script itself serves as a change log. The structured output (cleaned files and reports) also allows tracking changes between different runs or versions of the cleaning process, ensuring reproducibility and aiding in debugging or auditing.
